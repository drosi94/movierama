## Technical Details


#### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Technologies</span>



*   HTML5 / CSS3 / Javascript (ES6+)
*   Webpack
*   Babel
*   Workbox (Service worker for creating PWAs)
*   Jest


#### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Methodologies</span>


    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Component-based</span>


    Each element (header, movie list, movie item, footer) of the web app has its own component using the [HtmlElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) interface.


    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">MVC Pattern</span>


    The UI is separated from the logic and the service needed to retrieve the data, makes easier the testing of the different aspects.


    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mobile-First Design</span>


    Designing the UI optimized for mobiles by the beginning resulting to have fully responsive layouts a lot easier.


    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">PWA</span>


    Making the web app progressive adds extra functionality, like



*   Can be installed as an application in mobile phones.
*   Works without an internet connection, caching HTTP requests and assets


#### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Development Environment</span>

Webpack is used as module bundler and with babel compiler, we can bundle our  application in a single .js file ready to use in a browser using the latest (supported by babel) features of Javascript. Also, we can include loaders and plugins to the webpack configuration to add extra functionality such as importing HTML/CSS files to Javascript and generating service workers.


#### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deployment</span>

The deployment process is automated using [heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/). When a push occurs in the **heroku** branch a builder runs to build the application and serve it through a Node.JS (Express) server. The PWA can be accessed [here](https://vdrosatos-movierama.herokuapp.com/).
